ofxPlaymodes
============

ofxPlaymodes is an addon to make easy to work with video and audio buffers and headers that can point at any position in the buffer to be rendered. This allows to use different effects like composition of multiple delays.

**************************************************
I am forking Arturo's version of playModes in order to start hacking Maximilian into the addon to provide granular audio support.
